# Let's do some multiplication tables!
# Write a function that does the following:

#   Returns a matrix of size n by n, where the entries of the matrix are the product of the indices of that array.    
# I.e. for n=5, the [3,2] entry is 3 * 2 = 6

# HINTS: 
# 1. Initialize the Matrix with one of the commands we've just discussed
# 2. Use two nested for loops
# 3. M[i,j] will give you element in the i-th row and j-th column

# Broadcasting
# In Julia, definitions of functions follow the rules of mathematics
x = [1 2 3]
size(x)
y = [1, 2, 3]
x*y # the "*" follows matrix multiplication rules (1,3)*(3,1) --> (1,1)
x'
transpose(x)

x*x'

# How should we multiply two vectors element-wise?
y = [1,2,3]
x = [2,2,2]

# x*y <- You get an error, as multiplication of a vector by a vector is not a valid mathematical operation.

# Instead, we need to broadcast the multiplication. In Julia, adding broadcasting to an operator is easy. You just prefix it with a dot (.), like this:
y .* x
# NOTE: the dimensions of the passed objects must match:
y = [1,2,3]
x = [2,2]
y.*x # error

y = [1,2,3]
x = [2,2,2]
# we can get the same result with a simple loop - NOTE: in Julia loops are fast
z = similar(y)
for i in eachindex(y, x)
    z[i] = y[i] * x[i] 
end

# using map 
map(*, x, y)  # The passed function (*, in this case) is applied iteratively elementwise to those collections until one of them is exhausted

# Broadcasting Functions:
times_two(x) = 2 * x
times_two(5)
times_two.(y)
# those can be built-in functions
log.(y)

# or using map function
map(x -> 2*x, y)

# Expanding length-1 dimensions in broadcasting

# There is one exception to the rule that dimensions of all collections taking part in
# broadcasting must match. This exception states that single-element dimensions get
# expanded to match the size of the other collection by repeating the value stored in
# this single element:

[1, 2, 3] .- 1
[1, 2, 3] .- 2

# Multiplication table returns!
# Write a function that does the following:
#   Accepts n, which is the maximum value of a times table.
#   Returns a matrix of size n by n, where the entries of the matrix are the product of the indices of that array.    
# I.e. for n=5, the [3,2] entry is 3 * 2 = 6

# BUT!
# The body of the function must contain only two lines of code:
# 1. Initialize the array containing values 1 to N (see around line 46 for hints)
# 2. Use vector operations (transpose) & broadcasting to get the multiplication table. Do not use any loops.
