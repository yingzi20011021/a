#Let's do some multiplication tables!
#Write a function that does the following:
#   Accepts n, which is the maximum value of a times table.
#   Returns a matrix of size n by n, where the entries of the matrix are the product of the indices of that array.    
# I.e. for n=5, I want to see a matrix where the [3,2] entry is 3 * 2 = 6

# HINTS: 
# 1. Initialize the Matrix with one of the commands we've just discussed
# 2. Use two nested for loops
# 3. M[i,j] will give you element i i-th row and j-th column

# Broadcasting
# in Julia  definitions of functions follow the rules of mathematics
x = [1 2 3]
size(x)
y = [1,2,3]
x*y #the "*" follows matrix multiplication rules (1,3)*(3,1) --> (1,1)
x*x'
transpose(x)
# How then how we should multiply two vectors elementwise?
y = [1,2,3]
x = [2,2,2]

# x*y <- You get an error, as multiplication of a vector by a vector is not a valid mathematical operation.

# Instead, we need to broadcast the multiplication. In Julia, adding broadcasting to an operator is easy. You just prefix it with a dot (.), like this:
y .* x
#NOTE: the  dimensions of the passed objects must match:
y = [1,2,3]
x = [2,2]
# y.*x

y = [1,2,3]
x = [2,2,2]
#we can get similar with a simple loop - NOTE: in Julia loops are fast
z = similar(y)
for i in eachindex(y, x)
    z[i] = y[i] * x[i] 
end
z
#we can get the same result with a comprehension 
[y[i] * x[i] for i in eachindex(y, x)]
[0 for i in eachindex(y, x)]

#using map 
map(*, x, y)  #The passed function (*, in this case) is applied iteratively elementwise to those collections until one of them gets exhausted

#Broadcasting Functions:
times_two(x) = 2 * x
times_two(5)
times_two.(y)
#those can be build in functions
log.(y)

# we can get the same result as with a comprehension 
[log(i) for i in y]

#or using map function
map(log, y)
map(x -> 2*x, y)

#Expanding length-1 dimensions in broadcasting

#There is one exception to the rule that dimensions of all collections taking part in
#broadcasting must match. This exception states that single-element dimensions get
#expanded to match the size of the other collection by repeating the value stored in
#this single element:

[1, 2, 3] .- [2]

#Multiplication table returns!
#Write a function that does the following:
#   Accepts n, which is the maximum value of a times table.
#   Returns a matrix of size n by n, where the entries of the matrix are the product of the indices of that array.    
# I.e. for n=5, I want to see a matrix where the [3,2] entry is 3 * 2 = 6

#BUT!
#The body of function has to have two lines of code only:
#1. Initialize the array containing values 1 to N (see around line 200 for hints)
#2. Use vector operations (transpose) & broadcasting to get multiplication table. Do not use any loops.
