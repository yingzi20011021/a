### Functions ###
### (x,y) in the function below are arguments
function first_functionA(x,y)
    return x*y
end
first_functionA(3,2)
# You can also define a simple function this way:
first_functionB(x,y) = x*y 
first_functionB(3,2)

# You can define a new function that will use another function but ALWAYS evaluate it at a particular value
second_function(x) = first_functionB(x,3)

# 2 becomes a default value for y, though you can still change it when calling the function
function third_function(x,y=2)
    return x*y
end
third_function(3)
third_function(3,2)
third_function(3,3)

# Define a function for a line
function fourth_function(x,a,b)
    return a*x+b
end

# Sometimes it is useful to have parameters defined as KEYWORD arguments
function fifth_function(x; a, b)
    return a*x+b
end

fifth_function(2,2,1) # ERROR, you need to provide the names of arguments!

fifth_function(2, a=2, b=1)

# You can combine both keyword arguments and default values:
function sixth_function(x; a=2, b=1)
    return a*x+b
end

sixth_function(2, a=2, b=0) 
sixth_function(2)

# You can define a "squared" function in either of these ways:
function squared(x)
    return x^2
end
squared(x) = x^2

# Short syntax for defining simple functions
times_two(x) = 2 * x

# Consider the following polynomial function g(x, α, β, γ, δ) = α*x^3 + β*x^2 + γ*x + δ
# a. Write it in Julia such that α, β, γ, δ are keyword arguments. Test for arbitrary values of all parameters. 
# b. Now write a function h(x) that accepts only a value x but evaluates g at the coefficients 4, -3, 2, and 10.
# c. Plot function h at the interval (-100, 100), using a 0.1 step size

# Let's do some multiplication tables!
# Write a function that does the following:
#   Accepts n, which is the maximum value of a times table.
#   Returns a matrix of size n by n, where the entries of the matrix are the product of the indices of that array.    
# I.e. for n=5, the [3,2] entry is 3 * 2 = 6

# HINTS: 
# 1. Initialize the Matrix with one of the commands we've just discussed
# 2. Use two nested for loops
# 3. M[i,j] will give you element in the i-th row and j-th column

# Broadcasting
# In Julia, definitions of functions follow the rules of mathematics
x = [1 2 3]
size(x)
y = [1, 2, 3]
x*y # the "*" follows matrix multiplication rules (1,3)*(3,1) --> (1,1)
x*x'
transpose(x)
# How should we multiply two vectors element-wise?
y = [1,2,3]
x = [2,2,2]

# x*y <- You get an error, as multiplication of a vector by a vector is not a valid mathematical operation.

# Instead, we need to broadcast the multiplication. In Julia, adding broadcasting to an operator is easy. You just prefix it with a dot (.), like this:
y .* x
# NOTE: the dimensions of the passed objects must match:
y = [1,2,3]
x = [2,2]
# y.*x

y = [1,2,3]
x = [2,2,2]
# we can get the same result with a simple loop - NOTE: in Julia loops are fast
z = similar(y)
for i in eachindex(y, x)
    z[i] = y[i] * x[i] 
end
z
# we can get the same result with a comprehension 
[y[i] * x[i] for i in eachindex(y, x)]
[0 for i in eachindex(y, x)]

# using map 
map(*, x, y)  # The passed function (*, in this case) is applied iteratively elementwise to those collections until one of them is exhausted

# Broadcasting Functions:
times_two(x) = 2 * x
times_two(5)
times_two.(y)
# those can be built-in functions
log.(y)

# we can get the same result as with a comprehension 
[log(i) for i in y]

# or using map function
map(log, y)
map(x -> 2*x, y)

# Expanding length-1 dimensions in broadcasting

# There is one exception to the rule that dimensions of all collections taking part in
# broadcasting must match. This exception states that single-element dimensions get
# expanded to match the size of the other collection by repeating the value stored in
# this single element:

[1, 2, 3] .- [2]

mat_ones = ones(3,3)
vec_horizontal = [0.0 1.0 2.0]

vec_vertical .+ vec_horizontal

#############################        CONCEPT CHECK:         ############################# 
# Multiplication table returns!
# Write a function that does the following:
#   Accepts n, which is the maximum value of a times table.
#   Returns a matrix of size n by n, where the entries of the matrix are the product of the indices of that array.    
# I.e. for n=5, I want to see a matrix where the [3,2] entry is 3 * 2 = 6

# BUT!
# The body of the function must contain only two lines of code:
# 1. Initialize the array containing values 1 to N (see around line 200 for hints)
# 2. Use vector operations (transpose) & broadcasting to get the multiplication table. Do not use any loops.
